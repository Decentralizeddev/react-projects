              description=" Smart contracts form the basis for all dApps built on the blockchain, and they're typically written in custom languages such as Solidity (for Ethereum) or Cadence (for Flow).
They tend to be much simpler than traditional programs, but the risks are much higher - a single smart contract bug can lead to millions of dollars being drained in minutes!

              description="DApps or decentralized applications, are open-source applications that are used to interact with smart contracts (ex. tokens) that run on a peer-to-peer network of servers. These applications can be based on a variety of blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, EOS, Hyperledger, Polkadot, and others. Since dApps donâ€™t rely on central servers, this vastly reduces the risk of failure, making them more reliable than traditional applications. By eliminating the middleman between users and service providers, dApps allow for greater freedom."
